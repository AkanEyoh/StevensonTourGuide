# Language
Language choice for the frontend is Java. 
We'll also use Android Studio to convert the code into an actual phone application. 

# Visual Representation in Application Form
Once the application is opened, it will display to a splash screen and give the user two 
main choices of modes:
1) Find A Room
2) Tour Guide

## Find A Room Mode
The "Find A Room" mode is the main feature of the application that will ask the user to 
type in two room numbers. The first number will be which room he or she is currently next
to and the second number will be the final destination that he or she desires to go to.
If the user is outside, the user will be able to type in "outside" and a room number and
the application will calculate the shortest path based on Stevenson's outside
enterances. From there, the application should guide the user to the appropriate room
using pictures we've taken of Stevenson's hallways, staircases, and rooms as well as
visual cues that we put in ourselves such as arrows and directional instructions.

## Tour Guide Mode
The "Tour Guide Mode" is a side feature of the application that will allow the user to 
take a general tour of all 7 Stevenson buildings. The application would tell the user
to approach a specific outside location and walk a predetermined path through all 7
buildings. This feature is mainly for users who just want a general idea of the floor
system and naming conventions of Stevenson as well as a better idea of how to transition
from building to building.
